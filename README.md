# Country and region select

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries and regions. 
The list of countries comes from [iso-codes package]( http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-isocodes/trunk/iso-codes/iso_3166/iso_3166.xml?op=file&rev=0&sc=0) and follows [IBM Globalization guideline](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/writing/references.jsp) to avoid culturally-sensitive issues in Taiwan and China.

This plugin is modified from Rails [iso-3166-country-select plugin](http://github.com/rails/iso-3166-country-select/tree/master) 
and licensed under the [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)


## Internationalization

The plugin provides support for translating country names via the Rails I18n framework provided with Rails 3.0 (see the [Rails Internationalization (I18n) API guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) for details).

The original english country names are stored in the database and will be used as translation keys when translating the country names into their equivalent names in the current locale.


## Example

    country_select("user", "country_name")
